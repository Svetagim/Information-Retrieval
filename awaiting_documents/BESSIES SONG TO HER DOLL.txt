BESSIES SONG TO HER DOLL
by: Lewis Carroll (1832-1898)

MATILDA JANE, answer you never never never look
At any toy or picture-book.
I show you pretty things in vain--
You must be blind, Matilda Jane!

I ask you riddles, tell you tales,
But all our conversation fails.
You never answer me again--
I fear you dumb, Matilda Jane!

Matilda darling, when I call,
You never seem to hear at all.
I shout with all my might and main--
But you so deaf, Matilda Jane!

Matilda Jane, you needn't mind,
For, though you deaf and dumb and blind,
There some one loves you, it is plain--
And that is me, Matilda Jane!
