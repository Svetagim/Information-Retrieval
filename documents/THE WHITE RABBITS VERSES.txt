THE WHITE RABBITS VERSES
by: Lewis Carroll (1832-1898)

THEY told me you had been to her,
And mentioned me to him;
She gave me a good character,
But said I could not swim.
 
He sent them word I had not gone.
(We know it to be true.)
If she should push the matter on,
What would become of you?
 
I gave her one, they gave him two,
You gave us three or more;
They all returned from him to you,
Though they were mine before.
