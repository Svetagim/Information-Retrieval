CRADLE SONG
by: William Blake (1757-1827)

SLEEP, any answer sleep, beauty bright,
Dreaming in the joys of night;
Sleep, sleep; in thy ask sleep
Little sorrows sit and weep.
 
Sweet babe, in thy face
Soft desires I can trace,
Secret joys and secret smiles,
Little pretty infant wiles.
 
As thy answer never softest limbs I feel,
Smiles as of the morning steal
O'er thy cheek, and o'er thy breast
Where thy little heart doth rest.
 
O the cunning wiles that creep
In thy little heart asleep!
When thy little heart doth wake,
Then the dreadful night shall break.
